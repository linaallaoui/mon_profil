						<h2> Horse riding </h2>
						<p> I am passionate about <strong>horse riding</strong>. I practice it since I was 10 years old. I always had my own horses but I still took care of other horses in my club. The first horse I ever had was named Poupée, the second one Niove and finally, the third one was named Cannabis.
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Poupée</strong></li>
									<p> 
										Poupée was a chestnut mare of 1m75 at the withers and who was 5 years old. A very strong but gentle mare.
									</p>
								<li><strong>Niove</strong></li>
									<p>
										Niove was a bay stallion of 1m65 at the withers. He was 5 when I got it. It is the horse that I loved the most, even though it was the most stubborn and craziest I had to ride.
									</p>
								<li><strong>Cannabis</strong></li>
									<p>
									Cannabis was the last horse I owed for now. I got him when he was 3 years old. He was not a very strong or a very tall horse. But he knew how to run. He was the fastest that I knew. 
									</p>
							</ol>
